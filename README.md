# GPON
## Background information
GPON is an alternative to Etrhernet switching in campus networking. Replaces the traditional three-tier Ethernet design with a two-tier optic network which eleminates access and distribution Ethernet switches with passive optical devices.
## Terminology
- Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON) - Standard for **passive optical networks** (PON) published by the **ITU-T**.
- Optical Distribution Network (ODN) - The **physical fibre and optical devices** that distribute signal to users in telecommunications network. The **ODN** is composed of **passive optical components** (POS), such as optical fibers, and one or more passive optical splitters.
- Optical Network Ternimation (ONT)/ Optical Network Units (ONU) - **Connects** end-user **devices** into **the GPON network**. **Provides** the **optical to electrical signal conversion**. ONTs provide **AES encryption** via ONT key.
- Splitters - Used to aggregate or multiplex fiber optic signas to a single upstream fiber optical cable. (1:32 ratio)
- Optical Line Terminal (OLT) - Device that aggregates all optical signals from ONTs into a single multiplexed beam of light which is then converted into an electrical signal, formatted to Ethernet packet type standards for Layer 2 or Layer 3 forwarding.
- Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDN) - Wavelength-division multiplexing is a technology that multiplexes a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber that uses different wavelengths of laser light.
- GEM GPON encapsulation method (GEM) - A data frame transport scheme used in gigabit capable passive optical network
